        <h1><center>Welcome to Panda Craft 3D!</center></h1>

        <p><b>PANDA CRAFT 3D</b> - a game on PC that will 
    be a good free replacement for <b>Minecraft</b> - 
    the cult game of 2009 from the company Mojang. 
    You can move around the map, build, break blocks 
    and switch the camera. <b>Build everything 
    your imagination is capable of!</b></p>
        <p>As in all games, Panda Craft 3D has a save and load map feature.<br>
        <b>But remember:</b> your map is saved to a single file - saved_dat. If you want to have several maps - create a folder and move your map. Then you can simply replace the save in the data folder.
    If you have no saves and want to load a save, you will get an error 
    and reload the default map - <b><i>baseplate.txt</i></b>.</p>
        <p>You can also switch the game modes
         - <b>Classic</b> and <b>Noclip</b>.<br> 
        <b>Classic</b> mode will allow you to travel around the map and climb blocks. You can build and break blocks in this mode.
        <br><b>Noclip</b> mode will allow you to pass through blocks and fly. The ability to build is also available in this mode.<br>
